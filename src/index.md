# Corner by corner

We are a group of regular people who are finding common purpose in protesting the current regime's abuses of the Constitution. 

Our work started with a single person at a single intersection in Durham, N.C., and our goal is to find more like-minded people who share these objectives:

- Increase awareness of political events, given the lack of a shared source of truth in the media.
- Activate others to join us (in person or on another corner).
- Be visible in the media and to our representatives. 
- Make our representatives terrified of losing in 2026.

## Get involved

Joining us is simple: pick a corner and stand at it with a protest [sign](/pages/signs). Sounds scary? It can be, but also a source of so much reward in these awful times. It can also be the inspiration that others need to join *you*.
