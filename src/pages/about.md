# About Corner by Corner

## Our Origins

Corner by Corner began with a single person standing at an intersection in Durham, N.C., armed with nothing but a sign and a conviction that something needed to change. That simple act of resistance has grown into a network of concerned citizens determined to stand up for democracy.

## Our Mission

We are everyday people united in our concern for the state of our democracy. We believe in the power of visibility, consistency, and peaceful protest to effect change. By occupying public spaces—corner by corner—we're making our voices heard in ways that can't be ignored by the media, our elected representatives, or our fellow citizens.

## Our Values

- **Truth**: We promote fact-based awareness of political events
- **Democracy**: We stand for the defense of our Constitution and democratic institutions
- **Accountability**: We demand accountability from our elected officials
- **Solidarity**: We support one another in peaceful protest
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can participate, anywhere, anytime

## Our Impact

With each new person who joins us at a corner, our movement grows stronger. Our representatives are taking notice. The media is paying attention. And most importantly, we're reminding our fellow citizens that they are not alone in their concerns and that there is something they can do.
