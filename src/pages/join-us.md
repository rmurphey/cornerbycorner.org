# Join Us

Thank you for your interest in joining our movement! Getting started is simple, and every person makes a difference.

## How to Join

- **Pick a corner:** Choose a visible intersection in your community with good foot or vehicle traffic.
- **Make a sign:** Check out our [sign suggestions](/pages/signs) or create your own message that resonates with you.
- **Show up consistently:** Even 30 minutes once a week makes an impact. Consistency matters more than duration.
- **Bring a friend:** It's safer and more fun with others. Invite like-minded people to join you.
