# Safety Guidelines for Street Corner Demonstrations

Safety should always be your top priority when participating in street corner demonstrations. These guidelines will help you stay safe while exercising your right to peaceful protest.

## Safety Tips

- **Stay on public property**: Remain on sidewalks and public squares to avoid trespassing issues.
- **Remain non-violent and calm**: If confronted, stay calm and de-escalate the situation.
- **Consider filming**: Document your protest for both safety and accountability.
- **Come prepared**: Bring water and weather-appropriate clothing for comfort during extended demonstrations.
- **Know your rights**: Peaceful protest is constitutionally protected - familiarize yourself with local ordinances.
- **Remain anonymous**: Consider wearing hats, long sleeves, and long pants to protect your identity if needed.
- **Know your boundaries**: Trust your instincts and leave if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

Remember: Itâ€™s OK to put your safety first.
