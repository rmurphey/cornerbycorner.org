# Best Practices for Street Corner Signs

Effective signage increases your visibility and your impact when you’re demonstrating at street corners. These guidelines will maximize your message’s effectiveness, but remember: it's also OK to protest with words on a scrap of cardboard. *Don’t let the arts and crafts overwhelm you.*

## Sign Size

- **Standard Size**: 18" × 24" or 22" × 28" are ideal for visibility from passing vehicles.
- **Handheld Options**: 11" × 17" for individual demonstrators standing close to pedestrian traffic.
- **Large Impact**: For major intersections, consider 30" × 40" signs for maximum visibility.
- **Balance**: Choose a size you can comfortably hold for extended periods.

## Materials

- **Weather-resistant**: Corrugated plastic (coroplast) is durable and lightweight.
- **Budget-friendly**: Heavy poster board or foam core (protect from rain).
- **Sustainable**: Repurposed cardboard with clear coating for water resistance.
- **Handle Integration**: Add PVC pipe or wooden dowel handles for easier holding.
- **Acrylic paint or markers**: 

## Font & Text

- **Text Size**: Letters should be at least 4-6" tall for vehicle visibility.
- **Minimum Standard**: Text should be readable from 100 feet away
- **Font Choice**: Sans-serif fonts (like Arial, Helvetica) are more readable from a distance.
- **Contrast**: Dark text on light background or vice-versa (black on yellow is particularly visible).
- **Amount of Text**: Limit to 6-8 words maximum for drive-by readability.

## Design Tips

- **Bold Borders**: Add a 1-2" border in a contrasting color to make signs pop.
- **Simple Graphics**: Use basic, high-contrast imagery that's recognizable at a glance.
- **QR Codes**: Consider adding a QR code for pedestrians to get more information.
- **Color Psychology**: Red, yellow, and orange draw attention but use sparingly.

## Practical Considerations

- **Wind Resistance**: Cut U-shaped wind holes in larger signs to prevent them from acting like sails.
- **Two-sided**: Create identical signs on both sides or different messages for each direction.
- **Waterproofing**: Laminate paper signs or use clear packing tape to seal.
- **Reflection**: Avoid glossy finishes that might reflect sunlight and become unreadable.

## Positioning

- **Visibility**: Stand where you're visible but not blocking traffic or sidewalks.
- **Sign Height**: Hold signs between waist and shoulder height for optimal viewing.
- **Group Formation**: Space demonstrators 5-10 feet apart for multiple sign reading.

## Maintenance

- **Storage**: Store flat or rolled (not folded) to maintain appearance.
- **Reusability**: Design with interchangeable elements for multiple uses.
- **Repair Kit**: Bring tape and markers for on-site repairs.
